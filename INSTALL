**** YOU NEED GNOME RUNTIME AND DEVEL INSTALLED AND WORKING ****

INSTALLATION:
	./configure
	make
	make install

HOW TO REPORT A BUG:

make sure your gnome and gtk work all dandy. before you do anything else.
try compiling a confirmed gnome program, like balsa or yagirc.

if it won't compile
	uname -a > dump
	gtk-config --version >> dump
	./configure >> dump
	make >> dump 2> dump
	mail -s 'bmud make bug' br0ke@math.smsu.edu <dump

if it's a reproducable info, describe the problem as exactly as possable,
telling what it does and how you get it to do it. if it prints any
information to the xterm where you ran it, send that too. and some basic
system infos, like arch, OS, gtk version, gnome version... email all that to
br0ke@math.smsu.edu with "bmud bug" as the topic

an alternative is to join the mailing list and report the problem there, maybe
someone else has a solution? :)
