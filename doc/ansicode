They are the same as xterm/rxvt/konsole/linux console, etc.  Hopefully
there will be a reference at some point, but for now use others.

Generally, for the basic attributes, you have:

\E[nm

Where n is a decimal number:

30-37 sets foreground colours 0-7, 90-97 set colours 8-15.
40-47 sets background colours 0-7, 100-107 set colours 8-15.
1 is bold
4 is underline
5 is blink (unimplemented)
7 is reverse
22 turns off bold
24 turns off underline
25 turns off blink
27 turns off reverse
0 resets attributes

You can also combine them in one command, such as

\E[31;1;7;44m

Sets foreground 1, background 4, and bold/reverse.

(I might've got the foreground/background inverted)

It might, but the code effort is a less trivial than the current
stuff (it is trivial to invert bold/underline/revrse on/opff, but
to save colours would require a copy of the lines in question).

That really depends on what you're doing.  If you have your own keyboard
event handler, you can get the keystrokes yourself and process accordingly.
Then just use it to output stuff.  I guess it depends on what you
are doing.
