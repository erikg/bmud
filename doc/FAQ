Q: Why not use zvt?
A: A couple reasons. zvt doesn't support dynamic width fonts. While most people
   like static width fonts so the ascii 'art' comes out right, I like the 
   goudyoldstyle font. Another reason is when I was implementing the text box,
   the zvt widgets was very alpha, very buggy, and very difficult to use. I may
   implement it as an optional target, possably runtime (like in irssi?)
