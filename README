For more info, read 'PROPOSAL'...

started late aug5 '98

** INSTALLATION **

basic configure/make setup. Installed the binary to /usr/local/bin/bmud and the gnome desktop info to /usr/share/gnome/apps/Games/bmud.desktop. Don't even gotta restart panel, it *SHOULD* just automagically appear in the 'Games' section...

./configure
make
make install

** TODO **

DONE-ISH 1  aliasing, I said tt++ in the proposal, but I'm thinking more like ircII now
DONE-ISH 2  color and font selection dialog
3  connect wizard that'll store IP, port, and login info
4  automapper that can flag areas and have a 'quick goto' thing
5  logging?
DONE 6  fix the damn colors, I ripped the ansi shit form amcl and it's f*cked up
7  make the 'stat' box (lower left) auto-resizing
8  make the main window start clearing its buffer, maybe only keep the last
	200? lines? definitly has to be an option tho? *shrug*
DONE 9  fix the auto-scroll mechanism so if something happens when you're scrolled
	up it doesn't scroll all the way back down
10 speed up the display, apperantly this is important as proven by zmud?
11 make an equipment tree box (that's automatically updated, and has some dnd
12 make a character view box that shows 'score' and 'level' stuff and auto
	updates itself as stuff changes
13 bugfixes. It feels real robust right now (aug 8 morning) but I KNOW
	there's bugs in it that needs to be stomped

** HOW TO REPORT A BUG **

email erik@math.missouristate.edu or the mailing list
do NOT report bugs like "I click this and it doesn't work" if it's in todo
do NOT bitch and moan if it crashes and breaks something. It's alpha grade.
do NOT email me saying "it sucks", if you think it sucks, tell me WHY :)
do NOT ask if I will port to windows, or I'll be forced to bitchslap you so
hard your pimpdaddy, 'billy G', bruises so bad he has to go to the hospital

** HOW TO HELP OUT **

code patches welcome, minor fixes or large peices. Please send patches in
unified diff format

make distclean
cd ..
mv bmud-0.x bmud-0.x-neatoshiznitz
tar zxvf bmud-0.x.tar.gz
diff -urNb bmud-0.x bmud-0.x-neatoshiznitz > bmud-0.x-neatoshiznits.patch

please go thru the files and clip out the unnecessary stuff, uhhhhhh, diff
tends to put in a lot of trash from like config stuff and stuff :/

[Connect wizard]

The connection wizard is pretty easy. Just type in the number of the server
in the gtk_entry.

There's a DEFINE in bmud.h where you specify the filename where to look for
servers. The format of the list should be "host port", I have included an
examplelist called mudservers (dont expect all of them to work, they're
fictional :)).

One thing that I have noticed is that if you have many servers in your list you
get a really big Wizard window, to fix that I'll add a scrollbar.
